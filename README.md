Niko Lewis's Portfolio Project

Hey there, I’m a NYC-based creative software engineer fueled by an insatiable curiosity and mission to inject the magic of storytelling into digital projects!

I'm interested in transforming concepts into applications that tackle practical issues, unearthing hidden patterns in data (and life!), and exploring ways to create/ manage meaningful products and digital experiences.
