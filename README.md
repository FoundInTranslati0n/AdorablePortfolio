# AdorkablePortfolio
### What is this?
A humble portfolio project.

### Who am I? 
Hey there I'm Niko, Iâ€™m a NYC-based software engineer that loves incorporating the magic of storytelling into digital products and projects.

### Project Inspo

This is the first thing I've coded in 3 years and I really loved how much I was forced to stretch my UX skills to complete this project. I went into this wanting a portfolio that I could feel confident sharing. My design inspiration attempted to capture a cozy and thoughtful sort of playful to reflect my personality.

### Design Goals

* Limited colors, shapes, and images to make the most of white space and give the portfolio a modern (and I dare hope elegant feel). 
* Leaned into a consistent theme of professional yet light-hearted illustrations to keep users engaged while reading. 

### Tools
* Coded with vanilla HTML and vanilla css (with flexbox) to refresh my grasp of the basics.
* Icons were sourced from Icons8.com and thee illustrations from Storyset.com
