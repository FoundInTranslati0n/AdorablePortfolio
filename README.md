Niko Lewis's Portfolio Project




Hey there I'm Niko, Iâ€™m a NYC-based creative software engineer fueled by an insatiable curiosity and mission to inject the magic of storytelling into digital projects!

I'm interested in transforming concepts into applications that tackle practical issues, unearthing hidden patterns in data (and life!), and exploring ways to create/ manage meaningful products and digital experiences. 
Reach out if your organization can benefit from critical thinking, creativity, effective communication, and collaborative spirit.

This is the first thing I've coded in years for The Knowledge House's webdev foundations assesment. I really loved how much I was forced to stretch to complete this project. And I'm pretty proud of what I accomplished in 6 days. I went into this know I wanted a real portfolio that I could be proud to have to come out of the process. My design theme attempted to capture a cozy vibe, a mature sort of playful that reflected my personality.

I deliberately limited the number of colors, shapes, and images to make the most of white space and give the portfolio a modern ( and I dare hope elegant feel). I also deliberately leaned into a consistent theme of professional yet fun illustrations to keep users engaged while reading. 

I learned to add depth and hints of texture using shadow-box through coding my resume, which was surprisingly challenging to get right for something that looks so simple. 

This portfolio was exclusively coded with HTML AND vanilla css (with flexbox) to develop a a good handle on the basics before moving into Javascript, React, and Tailwind CSS. My icons were sourced from Icons8.com and thee illustrations from Storyset.com

To practice my Markdown, I'll share the assignment criteria below:
